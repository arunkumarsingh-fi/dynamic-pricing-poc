```

### Core Components
- **UI Frontend**: Streamlit app for user interaction and business intelligence
- **ML Backend**: FastAPI server running contextual bandit algorithms
- **Data Layer**: CSV-based storage for demo data and feedback history

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development (No Containers)
```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r ml_model/requirements.txt
pip install -r ui_app/requirements.txt

# 2. Generate demo data
python data_simulator.py

# 3. Start ML API (Terminal 1)
python ml_model/price_recommendation_app.py

# 4. Start UI (Terminal 2)  
streamlit run ui_app/ui.py --server.port=8502
```

### Container Development
```bash
# View logs while developing
./deploy.sh logs

# Quick restart after code changes
./deploy.sh restart
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues**
```bash
./deploy.sh status    # Check if containers are running
./deploy.sh logs      # View error logs
```

**Data Issues**
```bash
python etl_worker/etl_task.py    # Regenerate demo data
```

**Port Conflicts**
- UI runs on 8502 (not 8501) to avoid Streamlit conflicts
- API runs on 5002
- Check for conflicting services: `lsof -i :8502`
